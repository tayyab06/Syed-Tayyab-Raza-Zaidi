To verify the results, you can run webpack to bundle the app by running webpack, then open the index.html file in a browser to view the result. The app should display the information returned by the referenced bundle and the CSS styling should be applied. You can check the source code of the page in the browser's developer tools to confirm that there are two separate bundles (vendor.bundle.js and app.bundle.js).
